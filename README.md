## Description

reactWeatherDashboard is a React remake of WeatherDashboard, a web application made to check the weather in different cities. The components of the app are broken down into three parts: a search bar, current weather, and a five-day forecast table. Data used to populate each component is the same as the original: city name, today's date, temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind, and UV index. All data us taken from the OpenWeather API.
